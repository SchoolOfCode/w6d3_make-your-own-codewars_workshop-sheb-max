// You are a cash machine. You can dispense notes of 5, 10 and 20.
// Given an input from 5 to 100.
// Dispense from your cash machine that number with the less notes as possible.
// Function should return a number following this examples:
// Input 55 ===> 211 (1st Digit for 20s, 2nd for 10s, 3rd for 5s)
// Input 5 ===> 1 (We delete cero's on the left. So instead of return 001 should return 1)
// Input 15 ===> 11
// Input > 100 ===> "You cannot do that to me. Do you think I am made of money?"
